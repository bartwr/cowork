## Idea: cowork.co / worktogether.co / cowork.nu

Basically a form:

- Who are you?
- What are you working on?
- What knowledge can you share?
- What knowledge would you like to receive?

Awesome, why not add cowork.nu as an app, so you will receive updates if we see a relevant connection? -> Add to your homescreen.
